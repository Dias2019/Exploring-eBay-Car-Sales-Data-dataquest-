# Exploring-eBay-Car-Sales-Data-
In this project we'll work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website. The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyse the included used car listings.

The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database/data) (the version uploaded to Kaggle was cleaned to be easier to work with). Originally, Kaggle dataset was consisting of 370,000 cars, therefore, we took a sample of 5,000 to ease learning and calculation process.
